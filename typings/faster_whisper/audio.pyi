"""We use the PyAV library to decode the audio: https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV

The advantage of PyAV is that it bundles the FFmpeg libraries so there is no additional
system dependencies. FFmpeg does not need to be installed on the system.

However, the API is quite low-level so we need to manipulate audio frames directly.
